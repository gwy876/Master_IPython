## Master Jupyter
Random IPython Notebooks that thematically belong to the thesis

See this as a random pile of important stuff on your desk.  
These IPython notebooks represent interactive documentation and data sanitization for my Masters' Thesis environment.  
To be able to make use of them at the max, you'll need:
 - the [CICIDS2017 Dataset](http://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)
 - a Splunk server with the index *cicids17*
 - a workstation with a GeForce GTX980 or bigger 
 - Tensorflow (ideally with GPU support) set up and running according to the [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)

My particular setup is documented in greater detail in my [recent blogposts](https://maddosaurus.github.io/).  
If you've got feedback, an idea or questions, you're more than welcome to contact me.
